<h3 align = "center">Fitness Progress Tracker Application</h3>

## About:
Fit Track allows users to achieve their fitness goals more quickly by keeping track of their workout progress. Users can *view*, *create* and *track* their daily workouts as well as, logging multiple workouts on a given day. Detailed information about the exercise can be specified, and viewing the **total duration** is also possible.

## Usage:
Since this is just a basic tracker with only the functionality to keep track, there are no users on any other authentication which makes the usage pretty simple and easy.
- `Home page` allows adding exercsies to your most `recent workout plan` or to a `new workout plan`
- `Dashboard` allows to view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts, additionally displaying the total duration for each workout.

## Improvements:
This application is nothing more than just to practice creating a `RESTful API` using `mongoDB` and the **ODM** `mongoose`. The idea of a Fitness Tracker can definitely be made much better with user accounts, many other exercise types and even health stats.
> I definitely enjoyed using **MongoDB** for the first time, even though I had issues with configuring `virtuals` at first, I think it's a normal process of trying new technologies.
